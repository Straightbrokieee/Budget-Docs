### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm
```

### Local Development

To start a local development server that opens a browser window, use:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This command launches the development environment, where most changes are automatically reflected live without requiring a server restart.

### Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
